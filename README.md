# LightSpeed

Overview of the Project
“This project is a simple simulation using JavaScript to estimate the speed of light. It works by moving an object (representing light) across a defined path at a given speed. The time taken is measured, and using the formula speed = distance / time, it calculates the estimated speed of light.”

## Technologies Used
### Frontend:
#### 1. HTML → Structure of the webpage.
#### 2. CSS → Styling the elements.
#### 3. JavaScript → Controls the logic, animation, and event handling.
#### 4. DOM Manipulation → Updates UI dynamically based on user interaction.
#### 5. requestAnimationFrame() → Creates smooth animations with optimal performance.
#### 6. Performance API (performance.now()) → High-precision time measurement for accurate calculations.
