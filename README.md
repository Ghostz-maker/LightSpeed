# LightSpeed

Overview of the Project
“This project is a simple simulation using JavaScript to estimate the speed of light. It works by moving an object (representing light) across a defined path at a given speed. The time taken is measured, and using the formula speed = distance / time, it calculates the estimated speed of light.”
