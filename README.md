# LightSpeed

Overview of the Project
“This project is a simple simulation using JavaScript to estimate the speed of light. It works by moving an object (representing light) across a defined path at a given speed. The time taken is measured, and using the formula speed = distance / time, it calculates the estimated speed of light.”

Technologies Used
Frontend:
HTML → Structure of the webpage.
CSS → Styling the elements.
JavaScript → Controls the logic, animation, and event handling.
DOM Manipulation → Updates UI dynamically based on user interaction.
requestAnimationFrame() → Creates smooth animations with optimal performance.
Performance API (performance.now()) → High-precision time measurement for accurate calculations.
